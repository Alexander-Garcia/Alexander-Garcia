### Hola, hello, ciao ğŸ¤˜

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a buffet of things. I also love to play instruments (guitar, drums, piano) and travel the world for several months at a time with just a backpack (15 countries so far!)
- ğŸ¤“ Iâ€™m interested in deep learning as I use Fast.ai's course along with graduate school classes at UMSL to get a little nerdy
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything related to deep learning / machine learning! Its tough
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Carrier pigeon.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was once a college dropout. I went back to get my B.S in Computer Science and I'm currently working toward my Masters with an emphasis on AI and Data Science
